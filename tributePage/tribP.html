          <h3>One of the Baguio Cosplayers of all time.</h3>
          <p>Starting around 2017, she had experience with cosplaying before, but during the boom in popularity of cosplaying and the subsequent rise in support from the local government, she invested more on her cosplays. The most popular cosplay at the time was Genshin Impact and she loved the characters from the game so much she ended up renting and buying a lot. She is a great cosplayer and has mastery in outfit designs. She is the one that got me into cosplaying my favorite characters and helped me with my outfits.</p>

          <div class="cosLi1">
            <h2>Ganyu</h2>
            <li>
              One of her first Genshin cosplays, it became her signature cosplay within the community with the umbrella
              as she often tries on different outfits and dresses that fits her style and personality.

          <div class="cosLi2">
            <h2>Keqing</h2>
            <li>
              Another cosplay often used on many outfits, Keqing is Ganyu's closest peers. Often used for
              more casual cosplays but also used by her boyfriend to cosplay as a lesbian couple, one of the popular
              ships in the fandom.

            <h2>
              Hu Tao
            </h2>
            <li>
              The crowd favorite halloween character, and short character. She captures the playful mischief of Hu Tao well,
              and rocks the casual version too like a Hu Tao pretending to be a Baguio student.

            <h2>Sucrose</h2>
            <li>
              Since she loves her boyfriend very much, she decided to buy a cosplay to match his signature cosplay, Albedo,
              to cosplay the popular ship "Alberose". Ever since, they are usually found cosplaying these together on their
              cosplay dates around Baguio.

            <h2>Fu Xuan</h2>
            <li>
              A rather spontaneous purchase, she bought this while Honkai Star Rail was still hot news. She quickly got
              comfortable with the character and went on to win in a Christmas cosplay competition event by
              the City of Baguio.
